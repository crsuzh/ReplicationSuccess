Description: Provides utilities for the design and analysis of replication studies.
    Features both traditional methods based on statistical significance and
    more recent methods such as the sceptical p-value; Held L. (2020) <doi:10.1111/rssa.12493>.
    Also provides related methods including the harmonic mean chi-squared test; Held, L. (2020), <doi:10.1111/rssc.12410>,
    and intrinsic credibility; Held, L. (2019) <doi:10.1098/rsos.181534>.
    Contains datasets from four large-scale replication projects.
