#' }
#'
#' @details Two-sided p-values were calculated assuming normality of Fisher-z
#'     transformed effect estimates.A two-stage procedure was used for the
#'     replications. In stage 1, the authors had 90\% power to detect 75\% of
#'     the original effect size at the 5\% significance level in a two-sided
#'     test. If the original result replicated in stage 1 (two-sided P-value <
#'     0.05 and effect in the same direction as in the original study), the data
#'     collection was stopped. If not, a second data collection was carried out
#'     in stage 2 to have 90\% power to detect 50\% of the original effect size
#'     for the first and the second data collections pooled. \code{n75} and
#'     \code{n50} are the planned sample sizes calculated to reach 90\% power in
#'     stage 1 and 2, respectively. They sometimes differ from the sample sizes
#'     that were actually collected (\code{ni} and \code{nr}, respectively). See
#'     supplementary information of Camerer et al. (2018) for details.

#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{experiment}}{Experiment name}
#' \item{\code{type}}{Type of study, either "original", "self-replication", or
#' "external-replication"}
#' \item{\code{lab}}{The lab which conducted the study, either 1, 2, 3, or 4.}

#' \item{\code{se}}{Standard error of standardized mean difference effect estimate}
#' \item{\code{n}}{Total sample size of the study}
#' }
#'
#' @details This data set originates from a prospective replication project
#'     involving four laboratories. Each of them conducted four original studies
#'     and for each original study a replication study was carried out within
#'     the same lab (self-replication) and by the other three labs
#'     (external-replication). Most studies used simple between-subject designs
#'     with two groups and a continuous outcome so that for each study, an
#'     estimate of the standardized mean difference (SMD) could be computed from
#'     the group means, group standard deviations, and group sample sizes. For
#'     studies with covariate adjustment and/or binary outcomes, effect size
#'     transformations as described in the supplementary material of Protzko
#'     (2020) were used to obtain effect estimates and standard errors on SMD
#'     scale. The data set is licensed under a CC-By Attribution 4.0
