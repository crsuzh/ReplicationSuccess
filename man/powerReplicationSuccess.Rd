\title{Computes the power for replication success}
\usage{
powerReplicationSuccess(
  zo,
  c = 1,
  level = 0.025,
  designPrior = c("conditional", "predictive", "EB"),
  alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"),
  type = c("golden", "nominal", "liberal", "controlled"),
  shrinkage = 0,
  h = 0,
  strict = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zo}{Numeric vector of z-values from original studies.}

\item{c}{Numeric vector of variance ratios of the original and replication
effect estimates. This is usually the ratio of the sample size of the
replication study to the sample size of the original study.}

\item{level}{Numeric vector of replication success levels. The default is
0.025.}

\item{designPrior}{Either "conditional" (default), "predictive", or "EB". If
"EB", the power is computed under a predictive distribution, where
the contribution of the original study is shrunken towards zero based on
the evidence in the original study (with an empirical Bayes shrinkage
estimator).}

\item{alternative}{Either "one.sided" (default) or "two.sided". Specifies if
the replication success level is one-sided or two-sided. If the
replication success level is one-sided, then power calculations are based
on a one-sided assessment of replication success in the direction of the
original effect estimates.}

\item{type}{Recalibration type can be either "golden" (default), "nominal"
(no recalibration), "liberal", or "controlled". \code{type} = "golden"
ensures that for an original study just significant at the specified
\code{level}, replication success is only possible if the replication
effect estimate is larger than the original one.
"controlled" ensures exact Type-I error control at level \code{level}^2
for \code{alternative} is "two.sided" or "one.sided" if the direction 
was pre-specified in advance. For \code{alternative} is "one.sided" 
and no pre-specified direction, the Type-I error rate is controlled at 
level 2*\code{level}^2.
 See
\code{\link{levelSceptical}} for details about recalibration types.}

\item{shrinkage}{Numeric vector with values in [0,1). Defaults to 0.
Specifies the shrinkage of the original effect estimate towards zero,
e.g., the effect is shrunken by a factor of 25\% for
\code{shrinkage = 0.25}. Is only taken into account if the
\code{designPrior} is "conditional" or "predictive".}

\item{h}{Numeric vector of relative heterogeneity variances i.e., the ratio
of the heterogeneity variance to the variance of the original effect
estimate. Default is 0 (no heterogeneity). Is only taken into account
when \code{designPrior} = "predictive" or \code{designPrior} = "EB".}

\item{strict}{Logical vector indicating whether the probability for
replication success in the opposite direction of the original effect
estimate should also be taken into account. Default is \code{FALSE}.
Only taken into account when \code{alternative} = "two.sided".}
}
\value{
The power for replication success.
}
\description{
Computes the power for replication success based on the result of the
original study, the corresponding variance ratio, and the design prior.
}
\details{
\code{powerReplicationSuccess} is the vectorized version of
    \code{.powerReplicationSuccess_}. \code{\link[base]{Vectorize}} is used
    to vectorize the function.

\examples{
## larger sample size in replication (c > 1)
powerReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.005), c = 2, level = 0.025, designPrior = "conditional")
powerReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.005), c = 2, level = 0.025, designPrior = "predictive")

## smaller sample size in replication (c < 1)
powerReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.005), c = 1/2, level = 0.025, designPrior = "conditional")
powerReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.005), c = 1/2, level = 0.025, designPrior = "predictive")

powerReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.00005), c = 2, level = 0.05, 
                        alternative = "two.sided",  strict = TRUE, shrinkage = 0.9)
powerReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.00005), c = 2, level = 0.05, 
                        alternative = "two.sided", strict = FALSE, shrinkage = 0.9)
