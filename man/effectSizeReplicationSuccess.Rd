\title{Computes the minimum relative effect size to achieve replication success
with the sceptical p-value}
\usage{
effectSizeReplicationSuccess(
  zo,
  c = 1,
  level = 0.025,
  alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"),
  type = c("golden", "nominal", "controlled")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zo}{Numeric vector of z-values from original studies.}

\item{c}{Numeric vector of variance ratios of the original and replication effect estimates.
This is usually the ratio of the sample size of the replication study to the sample
size of the original study.}

\item{level}{Threshold for the calibrated sceptical p-value.
Default is 0.025.}

\item{alternative}{Specifies if \code{level} is "one.sided" (default) or "two.sided".
If "one.sided", then effect size calculations are based on a one-sided assessment of
replication success in the direction of the original effect estimate.}

\item{type}{Type of recalibration. Can be either "golden" (default), "nominal" (no recalibration),
 or "controlled". "golden" ensures that for an original study just significant at
the specified \code{level}, replication success is only possible for
replication effect estimates larger than the original one.
"controlled" ensures exact overall Type-I error control at level \code{level}^2.}
}
\value{
The minimum relative effect size to achieve replication success
with the sceptical p-value.
}
\description{
The minimum relative effect size (replication to original) to achieve replication success
with the sceptical p-value
is computed based on the result of the original study and the corresponding variance ratio.
}
\details{
With \code{type = "controlled"}, the overall Type-I error rate 
is controlled at level \code{level}^2 if \code{alternative} is
\code{"one.sided"} and the direction was pre-specified in advance.

\examples{
po <- c(0.001, 0.002, 0.01, 0.02, 0.025)
zo <- p2z(po, alternative = "one.sided")

effectSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = zo, c = 1, level = 0.025,
                             alternative = "one.sided", type = "golden")

effectSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = zo, c = 10, level = 0.025,
                             alternative = "one.sided", type = "golden")

                             alternative = "one.sided", type = "controlled")
effectSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = zo, c= 2, level = 0.025,
                             alternative = "one.sided", type = "nominal")

effectSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = zo, c = 2, level = 0.05,
