\title{Computes the replication success level}
\usage{
levelSceptical(
  level,
  c = NA,
  alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"),
  type = c("golden", "nominal", "controlled")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{Threshold for the calibrated sceptical p-value.
Default is 0.025.}

\item{c}{The variance ratio. Only required when \code{type = } "controlled".}

\item{alternative}{Specifies if \code{level} is "one.sided" (default) or
 "two.sided". If "one-sided",
then a one-sided replication success level is computed.}

\item{type}{Type of recalibration. Can be either "golden" (default),
"nominal" (no recalibration),
 or "controlled". "golden" ensures that for an original study just
significant at
the specified \code{level}, replication success is only possible for
replication effect estimates larger than the original one.
"controlled" ensures exact overall Type-I error control at level
\code{level}^2.}
}
\value{
Replication success levels
}
\description{
The replication success level is computed based on the specified
alternative and recalibration type.
