\title{Computes the required relative sample size to achieve replication success
based on power}
\usage{
sampleSizeReplicationSuccess(
  zo,
  power = NA,
  level = 0.025,
  alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"),
  type = c("golden", "nominal", "liberal", "controlled"),
  designPrior = c("conditional", "predictive", "EB"),
  shrinkage = 0,
  h = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zo}{Numeric vector of z-values from original studies.}

\item{power}{The power to achieve replication success.}

\item{level}{Numeric vector of replication success levels. The default is
0.025.}

\item{alternative}{Either "one.sided" (default) or "two.sided". Specifies if
the replication success level is one-sided or two-sided.
If the
replication success level is one-sided, then sample size calculations are based
on a one-sided assessment of replication success in the direction of the
original effect estimates.}

\item{type}{Recalibration type can be either "golden" (default), "nominal"
(no recalibration), "liberal", or "controlled". \code{type} = "golden"
ensures that for an original study just significant at the specified
\code{level}, replication success is only possible if the replication
effect estimate is larger than the original one.
"controlled" ensures exact overall Type-I error control at level \code{level}^2
for \code{alternative} is "two.sided" or "one.sided" if the direction 
was pre-specified in advance. For \code{alternative} is "one.sided" 
and no pre-specified direction, the overall Type-I error rate is controlled at 
level 2*\code{level}^2.
 See
\code{\link{levelSceptical}} for details about recalibration types.}

\item{designPrior}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified.
Either "conditional" (default), "predictive", or "EB". If "EB", the power
is computed under a predictive distribution where the contribution of the
original study is shrunken towards zero based on the evidence in the
original study (with an empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator).}

\item{shrinkage}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified. A
number in [0,1) with default 0. Specifies the shrinkage of the original
effect estimate towards zero (e.g., the effect is shrunken by a factor of
25\% for \code{shrinkage = 0.25}). Is only taken into account when the
\code{designPrior} is "conditional" or "predictive".}

\item{h}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified and
\code{designPrior} is "predictive" or "EB". The relative between-study
heterogeneity, i.e., the ratio of the heterogeneity variance to the
variance of the original effect estimate. Default is 0 (no
heterogeneity).}
}
\value{
The relative sample size for replication success. If impossible to
    achieve the desired power for specified inputs \code{NaN} is returned.
}
\description{
The relative sample size to achieve replication success is computed based on
the z-value of the original study, the replication success level, the type of
recalibration the power and the design prior.
}
\details{
\code{sampleSizeReplicationSuccess} is the vectorized version of
    \code{.sampleSizeReplicationSuccess_}. \code{\link[base]{Vectorize}} is
    used to vectorize the function.

## based on power
