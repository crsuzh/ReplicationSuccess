\title{Computes the required relative sample size to achieve replication success
based on power or on the minimum relative effect size}
\usage{
sampleSizeReplicationSuccess(
  zo,
  power = NA,
  d = NA,
  level = 0.025,
  alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"),
  type = c("golden", "nominal", "liberal", "controlled"),
  designPrior = c("conditional", "predictive", "EB"),
  shrinkage = 0,
  h = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zo}{Numeric vector of z-values from original studies.}

\item{power}{The power to achieve replication success.}

\item{d}{The minimum relative effect size (ratio of the effect estimate from
the replication study to the effect estimate from the original study) to
achieve replication success.}

\item{level}{Numeric vector of replication success levels. The default is
0.025.}

\item{alternative}{Either "one.sided" (default) or "two.sided". Specifies if
the replication success level is one-sided or two-sided.}

\item{type}{Type of recalibration. Can be either "golden" (default),
"nominal" (no recalibration), "liberal", "controlled". "golden" ensures
that for an original study just significant at the specified
\code{level}, replication success is only possible if the replication
effect estimate is at least as large as the original one. See
\code{\link{levelSceptical}} for details about recalibration types.}

\item{designPrior}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified.
Either "conditional" (default), "predictive", or "EB". If "EB", the power
is computed under a predictive distribution where the contribution of the
original study is shrunken towards zero based on the evidence in the
original study (with an empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator).}

\item{shrinkage}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified. A
number in [0,1) with default 0. Specifies the shrinkage of the original
effect estimate towards zero (e.g., the effect is shrunken by a factor of
25\% for \code{shrinkage = 0.25}). Is only taken into account when the
\code{designPrior} is "conditional" or "predictive".}

\item{h}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified and
\code{designPrior} is "predictive" or "EB". The relative between-study
heterogeneity, i.e., the ratio of the heterogeneity variance to the
variance of the original effect estimate. Default is 0 (no
heterogeneity).}
}
\value{
The relative sample size for replication success. If impossible to
    achieve the desired power for specified inputs \code{NaN} is returned.
}
\description{
The relative sample size to achieve replication success is computed based on
the z-value of the original study, the replication success level, the type of
recalibration and either the power or the minimum relative effect size. When
the approach based on power is used, the design prior also has to be
specified.

\details{
\code{sampleSizeReplicationSuccess} is the vectorized version of
    \code{.sampleSizeReplicationSuccess_}. \code{\link[base]{Vectorize}} is
    used to vectorize the function.

\examples{
## based on power
sampleSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.0025), power = 0.8, level = 0.025,
                             type = "golden")
sampleSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.0025), power = 0.8, level = 0.025,
                             type = "golden", designPrior = "predictive")

## based on minimum relative effect size
sampleSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.0025), d = 0.9, level = 0.025,
                             type = "nominal")
sampleSizeReplicationSuccess(zo = p2z(0.0025), d = 0.9, level = 0.025,
                             type = "golden")
