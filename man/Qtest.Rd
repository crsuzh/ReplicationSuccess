\title{Q-test to assess compatibility between original and
replication effect estimate}
\usage{
Qtest(thetao, thetar, seo, ser)
}
\arguments{
\item{thetao}{Numeric vector of effect estimates from original studies.}

\item{thetar}{Numeric vector of effect estimates from replication studies.}

\item{seo}{Numeric vector of standard errors of the original effect
estimates.}

\item{ser}{Numeric vector of standard errors of the replication effect
estimates.}
}
\value{
p-value from Q-test.
}
\description{
Computes p-value from meta-analytic Q-test to assess compatibility between
original and replication effect estimate.
}
\details{
This function computes the p-value from a meta-analytic Q-test
assessing compatibility between original and replication effect estimate.
Rejecting compatibility when the p-value is smaller than alpha is equivalent
with rejecting compatibility based on a (1 - alpha) prediction interval.
