\title{Probability of replicating an effect by Killeen (2005)}
\usage{
pReplicate(
  po = NULL,
  zo = p2z(p = po, alternative = alternative),
  c,
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{po}{Numeric vector of p-values from the original study,
default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{zo}{Numeric vector of z-values from the original study.
Is calculated from \code{po}, if necessary.}

\item{c}{The ratio of the variances of the original and replication
effect estimates.
This is usually the ratio of the sample size of the replication study
to the sample
size of the original study.}

\item{alternative}{Either "two.sided" (default) or "one.sided".
Specifies whether the p-value is two-sided or one-sided.}
}
\value{
The probability that a replication study yields an effect
estimate in the same direction as in the original study.
}
\description{
Computes the probability that a replication study yields an effect
estimate in the same direction as in the original study.
}
\details{
This extends the statistic p_rep ("the probability of
replicating an effect")
by Killeen (2005) to the case of possibly unequal sample sizes,
see also Senn (2002).

\examples{
pReplicate(po = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001), c = 1)
pReplicate(po = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001), c = 2)
pReplicate(po = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001), c = 2, alternative = "one.sided")
pReplicate(zo = c(2, 3, 4), c = 1)
