\description{
Data from the \emph{Social Sciences Replication Project} (SSRP)
    including the details of the interim analysis. The variables are as
follows:

\item{\code{rr}}{Effect estimate of replication study at the final analysis
on correlation scale}
\item{\code{fiso}}{Effect estimate of original study transformed to
Fisher-z scale}
\item{\code{fisi}}{Effect estimate of replication study at
the interim analysis transformed to Fisher-z scale}
\item{\code{fisr}}{Effect estimate of replication study at the final analysis
transformed to Fisher-z scale}
\item{\code{se_fiso}}{Standard error of Fisher-z transformed effect estimate
of original study}
\item{\code{se_fisi}}{Standard error of Fisher-z transformed effect estimate
of replication study at the interim analysis}
\item{\code{se_fisr}}{Standard error of Fisher-z transformed effect estimate
of replication study at the final analysis}
\item{\code{no}}{ Sample size in original study}
\item{\code{ni}}{Sample size in replication study at the interim analysis}
\item{\code{nr}}{Sample size in replication study at the final analysis}
\item{\code{po}}{Two-sided p-value from significance test of effect estimate
from original study}
\item{\code{pi}}{Two-sided p-value from significance test of effect
estimate from replication study at the interim analysis}
\item{\code{pr}}{Two-sided p-value from significance test of effect estimate
from replication study at the final analysis}
\item{\code{n75}}{Sample size calculated to have 90\% power in replication
study
to detect 75\% of the original effect size (expressed as the correlation
coefficient r)}
\item{\code{n50}}{Sample size calculated to have 90\% power in replication
study to detect 50\% of the original effect size (expressed as the
correlation coefficient r)}

\details{
Two-sided p-values were calculated assuming normality of Fisher-z
    transformed effect estimates.A two-stage procedure was used for the
    replications. In stage 1, the authors had 90\% power to detect 75\% of
    the original effect size at the 5\% significance level in a two-sided
    test. If the original result replicated in stage 1 (two-sided P-value <
    0.05 and effect in the same direction as in the original study), the data
    collection was stopped. If not, a second data collection was carried out
    in stage 2 to have 90\% power to detect 50\% of the original effect size
    for the first and the second data collections pooled. \code{n75} and
    \code{n50} are the planned sample sizes calculated to reach 90\% power in
    stage 1 and 2, respectively. They sometimes differ from the sample sizes
    that were actually collected (\code{ni} and \code{nr}, respectively). See
    supplementary information of Camerer et al. (2018) for details.
