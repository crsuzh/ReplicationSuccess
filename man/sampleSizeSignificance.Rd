\title{Computes the required relative sample size to achieve significance
based on power or on the minimum relative effect size}
\usage{
sampleSizeSignificance(
  zo,
  power = NA,
  d = NA,
  level = 0.025,
  alternative = c("one.sided", "two.sided"),
  designPrior = c("conditional", "predictive", "EB"),
  h = 0,
  shrinkage = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{zo}{A vector of z-values from original studies.}

\item{power}{The power to achieve replication success.}

\item{d}{The minimum relative effect size (ratio of the effect estimate from
the replication study to the effect estimate from the original study).}

\item{level}{Significance level. Default is 0.025.}

\item{alternative}{Either "one.sided" (default) or "two.sided". Specifies
direction of the alternative. "one.sided" assumes an effect in the same
direction as the original estimate.}

\item{designPrior}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified.
Either "conditional" (default), "predictive", or "EB". If "EB", the power
is computed under a predictive distribution where the contribution of the
original study is shrunken towards zero based on the evidence in the
original study (with an empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator).}

\item{h}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified and
\code{designPrior} is "predictive" or "EB". The relative between-study
heterogeneity, i.e., the ratio of the heterogeneity variance to the
variance of the original effect estimate. Default is 0 (no
heterogeneity).}

\item{shrinkage}{Is only taken into account when \code{power} is specified. A
number in [0,1) with default 0. Specifies the shrinkage of the original effect
towards zero (e.g., \code{shrinkage = 0.25} implies shrinkage by a
factor of 25\%). Is only taken into account when \code{designPrior} is
"conditional" or "predictive".}
}
\value{
The relative sample size to achieve significance in the specified
    direction. If impossible to achieve the desired power for specified
    inputs \code{NaN} is returned.
}
\description{
The relative sample size to achieve significance of the replication study is
computed based on the z-value of the original study, the significance level
and either the power or the minimum relative effect size. When the approach
based on power is used, the arguments design prior, shrinkage, and relative
heterogeneity also have to be specified.
}
\details{
\code{sampleSizeSignificance} is the vectorized version of
    \code{.sampleSizeSignificance_}. \code{\link[base]{Vectorize}} is used to
    vectorize the function.
