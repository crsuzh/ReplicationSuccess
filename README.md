# ReplicationSuccess

Provides utilities for the design and analysis of replication studies.
Features both traditional methods based on statistical significance and
more recent methods such as the sceptical p-value. Also provides related
methods including the harmonic mean chi-squared test and intrinsic credibility.
Contains datasets from four large-scale replication projects.
